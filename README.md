# Fee-Management-System-Using-Hive

The main aim of this system is to develop fee management system by using Hive. This system mainly reduces the work task and it is easy to
maintain the records for a long time than normal hand written records. 

The user can check his record details by just entering his name no need to search all the record. With the help of this system fee calculations can be done very easily by this system. So, the maintenance 
and management of fee becomes very easy.

The database holds details like Student name, Registration numbers, payment advice, Branch and Payment dues which eliminates the need for any hand written records and all the information you need about a particular student can be 
retrieved through a simple query.

Thus, this project efficiently manages the FEE SYSTEM reducing the amount of manual work and tasks to be done.

Database is an organized collection of data.

The data is typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information. 

HIVE makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.

The HIVE essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible
